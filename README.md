# Exploratory Data Analysis on Sleep Health Data

## Project Overview
This project focuses on performing a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a sleep health dataset to understand how sleep quality varies with age. The analysis aims to identify underlying patterns, trends, and relationships within the data using statistical methods and visual exploration.

In addition to descriptive analysis, a linear regression model is applied to examine whether age can serve as a predictor for sleep quality. The project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow, starting from data understanding and visualization to basic predictive modeling and evaluation.
